Instagram Direct Function Test Plan				
	
  
Introduction		

Instagram Direct is a private messaging feature on the popular mobile photo sharing app Instagram.			
Although Instagram has been around since 2010, no private messaging was available on the platform until Instagram Direct was finally launched in December 2013.			
It allows users to  share messages, photos, videos, profiles, posts, hashtags, locations with one or multiple users in a group:					
Optionally, user can merge Instagram Direct with Facebook Messenger and get all the features of Facebook's messaging feature accessible from his Instagram. Plus, 
messages from Facebook users will appear in this merged inbox.			
There are also three options to choose to limit unwanted communication with user: reporting, restricting and blocking users in Instagram Direct
